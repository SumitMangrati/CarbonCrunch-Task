## My approach to the design
I designed the website using Vite/React + Tailwind CSS. I converted the Figma design to Code. Used Reusable components all over my project for easiness and making the project Time Efficient.
I have made two versions of the project.
- One which is 2D - There are no 3D elements in this version and is inspired from the Figma Design.
I have tried to keep the color pallete consitent. Enabled Grid UI animation Interaction.
1st Interaction - OnHover the particualr gird box glows 
2nd Interaction - OnHover the grid box reveals the content while hiding the heading.
- Another which is 3D - I have implemented a interactive 3D element on home page where the earth follows the mouse. Integrated using Spline
